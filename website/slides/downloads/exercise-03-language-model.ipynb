    "### Character-based Markov model of language\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a class `MarkovModel` to `fit` an n-gram model of language and generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code below uses the hyperparameter `n`, which represents the state of the Markov model as the last `n` characters of a given string. In Exercise 1, we explored `n=1` (bigram model), where each state of the Markov model was a single character, and the generation of each character was dependent only on the previous character. We aim to incorporate more context to produce more intelligible text. For instance, with `n=3`, the probability distribution for the next character will be based on the preceding three characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that `n` in the term n-gram does not exactly correspond to the variable `n` in our implementation below. Instead `n` refers to the number of previous time steps to use as a context. For 2-gram (bigram) the value of the variable `n` is 1 which means considering one previous time step as context. For 4-gram the value of `n` is 3 which means considering three previous time steps as context.    \n",
    "\n",
    "To train our model, we record every occurrence of each n-gram and the subsequent character. Then, similar to the approach in naive Bayes, we normalize these counts to probabilities for each n-gram. The `fit` function implements these steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a new sequence, we start with some initial seed at least of length `n`. You can explicitly pass this seed when you call the `generate` method. By default, we will just use the first `n` characters in the training text as the seed, which are saved at the end of the `fit` function. Then, for the current n-gram we will look up the probability distribution over next characters and sample a character according to this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
