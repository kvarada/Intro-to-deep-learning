There are several models that extend the basic idea of using decision trees.\n\n## Random Forest\n\n![](img/random-forest.png)\n\nTrain an ensemble of distinct decision trees.\n\n## Random Forest\n\\\n\nEach tree trains on a random sample of the data. Some times the features used to split are also randomized at each node.\n\nIdea: Individual trees still learn noise in the data, but the noise should \"average out\" over the ensemble.\n\n## Gradient Boosted Trees\n\n![](img/boost.png)\n\nEach tree tries to \"correct\" or improve the previous tree's prediction.\n\n## Tree-Based Models\n\\ \n\nRandom Forest, XGBoost, etc are all easily available as \"out-of-the box solutions\".\n\nPros: \n\n* Perform well on a variety of tasks\n* Random forest in particular are easy to train and robust to outliers.\n\nCons:\n\n* Not always interpretable\n* Not good at handling sparse data\n* Can also still overfit.\n\n\n\n# Linear models\n\n## Linear models\n\\\n\n![](img/lse)\n\nMany of you might be familiar with least-squares regression. We find the line of best fit by minimizing the 'squared error' of the predictions.\n\n\n## Linear Models\n\\ \n![](img/outlierbad.png)\n\nSquared Error is very sensitive to outliers. Far-away points contribute a very large squared error, and even relatively few points can affect the outcome.\n\n## Linear Models\n\\ \n![](img/outliergood.png)\n\nWe can use other notions of \"best fit\". Using absolute error makes the model more resistant to outliers!\n\n## Linear Classifiers\n\\\n\nWe can also build linear models for classification tasks. The idea is to convert the output from an arbitrary number to a number between 0 and 1, and treat it like a \"probability\".\n\nIn *logistic regression*, we squash the output using the sigmoid function and then adjust parameters (in training) to find the choice that makes the data \"most likely\".\n\n## Linear Classifiers\n\n![](img/us-map.png)\n\nCan you guess what this dataset is?\n\n## Linear Classifiers\n\n![](img/logistic.png)\n\nLogistic Regression predicts a *linear* decision boundary.\n\n## Sentiment Analysis: An Example\n\n\n\n\\\nLet us attempt to use logistic regression to do sentiment analysis on a database of IMDB reviews. The database is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews?resource=download).\n\n::: {#220ceefd .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimdb_df = pd.read_csv(\"data/imdb_master.csv\", encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\nimdb_df.rename(columns={\"sentiment\": \"label\"}, inplace = True)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#73afe7d8 .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>review</th>\n      <th>label</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>One of the other reviewers has mentioned that ...</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>A wonderful little production. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The...</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>I thought this was a wonderful way to spend ti...</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Basically there's a family where a little boy ...</td>\n      <td>negative</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is...</td>\n      <td>positive</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe will use only about 10% of the dataset for training (to speed things up)\n\n\n\n## Bag of Words\n\\\nTo create features that logistic regression can use, we will represent these reviews via a \"bag of words\" strategy.\n\nWe create a new feature for every word that appears in the dataset. Then, if a review contains that word exactly once, the corresponding feature gets a value of 1 for that review. If the word appears four times, the feature gets a value of 4. If the word is not present, it's marked as 0.\n\n## Bag of Words\n\\\nNotice that the result is a sparse matrix. Most reviews contain only a small number of words.\n\n::: {#940dbdcb .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nvec = CountVectorizer(stop_words=\"english\")\nbow = vec.fit_transform(X_train)\nbow\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n<Compressed Sparse Row sparse matrix of dtype 'int64'\n\twith 439384 stored elements and shape (5000, 38867)>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are a total of 38867 \"words\" among the reviews.

Looks like our model learned something!\n\n## Tuning hyperparameters\n\\\n\nHowever, the training scores are perfect (and higher than validation scores) so our model is likely overfitting.\n\nMaybe it just memorized some rare words, each appearing only in one review, and associated these with the review's label. We could try reducing the size of our dictionary to prevent this.\n\n## Tuning hyperparameters\n\\\n\nThere are many tools available to automate the search for good hyperparameters. These can make our life easy, but there is always the danger of optimization bias in the results.\n\n\n\n## Investigating the model\n::: {.scroll-container style=\"overflow-y: scroll; height: 400px;\"}\n\\\n\nLet's see what associations our model learned.\n\n::: {#6039ffdf .cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=10}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Coefficient</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>excellent</th>\n      <td>0.792911</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>perfect</th>\n      <td>0.608851</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>amazing</th>\n      <td>0.602716</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>wonderful</th>\n      <td>0.564188</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>surprised</th>\n      <td>0.536449</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>waste</th>\n      <td>-0.669122</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>terrible</th>\n      <td>-0.697831</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>boring</th>\n      <td>-0.709981</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>awful</th>\n      <td>-0.870623</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>worst</th>\n      <td>-1.117365</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>5775 rows √ó 1 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Investigating the model\n\\\n\nThey make sense!

There was no attempt to maintain syntactical or grammatical structure or to study correlations between words.\n\nWe also trained on just 5000 examples. Nevertheless, our model performs quite well.\n\n\n\n## Linear Models\n\\\n\nPros:\n\n* Easy to train and to interpret\n* Widely applicable despite some strong assumptions\n* If you have a regression task, check whether a linear regression is already good enough! If you have a classification task, logistic regression is a go-to first option.\n\nCons:\n\n* Strong assumptions\n* Linear decision boundaries for classifiers\n* Correlated features can cause problems\n\n# (Optional) Analogy-based models\n\n## Analogy-based models\n\n![](img/us-map.png)\n\nReturning to our older dataset.\n\n## Analogy-based models\n\n![](img/us-map-dot.jpg)\n\nHow would you classify the green dot?\n\n## Analogy-based models\n\\\n\nIdea: predict on new data based on \"similar\" examples in the training data.\n\n## *K*-Nearest-Neighbour Classifier\n\\\n\nFind the *K* nearest neighbours of an example, and predict whichever class was most common among them.\n\n'*K*' is a hyperparameter. Choosing *K=1* is likely to overfit. If the dataset has *N* examples, setting *K=N* just predicts the mode (dummy classifier).\n\nNo training phase, but the model can get arbitrarily large (and take very long to make predictions).\n\n## SVM with RBF kernel\n\\ \n\nAnother 'analogy-based' classification method.\n\nThe model stores examples with positive and negative weights. Being close to a positive example makes your label more likely to be positive.\n\nCan lead to \"smoother\" decision boundaries than K-NNs, and potentially to a smaller trained model.\n\n## KNNs and SVMs\n\\ \n![](img/knn-vs-svm.png)\n\n## Analogy-based Models\n\\\n\nPros:\n\n* Do not need to make assumptions about the underlying data\n* Given enough data, should pretty much always work.\n\nCons:\n\n* *Enough* data can mean ... a lot\n* Computing distances is time-consuming for large datasets\n* Can't really interpret the model's decisions.\n\n## A Look Ahead\n\\\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) are also linear classifiers.\n\nThe reason we see a *non-linear* decision boundary is the use of the *RBF* kernel, which applies a certain non-linear transformation to the features.\n\nEven if our data is not linearly separable, there could be a good choice of feature transform out there that *makes* it linearly separable.\n\n##\n\nWouldn't it be nice if we could train a machine learning model to find such a transform?\n\n",
